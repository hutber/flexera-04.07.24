Hi Guys
thanks for checking out the test!

I've decided to go [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  and TS to get the test up and running "quick as" as the French say.

It's a pretty basic thing really. As I'm on kid duty today so my wife has given me an extra 2h to get it all done and 
dusted.

### Points

* I appoligise for the lack of "good clean code" I felt a little rushed while doing this as I wanted to fit 
  everything in within the time frame.
* I added in a entries dropdown, seemed like something easy and "fun" to add.
* The app is "mobile friendly" simply due to the fact that the content scales and is naturally easy. But it does not 
  have direct support for mobile. For this I would also use a grid from a component library, MUI, Charka or create a 
  component Grid within SC.
* I tried to handle going to the last 1000 results so the "next" button is disabled, but enjoy going to page 
  1000 for testing :D
